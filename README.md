# Match Tracker with FTOYD ARENA

This project was created and developed to improve React development skills, and also to implementation and demonstration of a test task.

## Important Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### And other scripts, like `npm run stylelint`, `npm run commit`, `npm run prepare`, etc.
